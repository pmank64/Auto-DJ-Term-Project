# Auto DJ Project

### Description

This software, written in C++, is designed to simulate a DJ, adding songs to a playlist, and playing them given user specification and commands. The software utilizes complex data structures to make song sorting and retrieving more efficient. There are numerous objects, including a Playlist, Song, SongLibrary, PlaylistNode, SongNode, and more. The software also has the ability to read in songs from a file, loading them into a linked list.

### Future Work

Currently, the software simulates a DJ, storing and generating strings. In the future, the software could be made to work with actual audio files, adding them to a playlist and playing them one at a time based on user commands. In addition, a GUI could be created to make the software more user friendly.
